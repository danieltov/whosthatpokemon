# Who's That Pokémon? A JS Word Guessing Game ([View Deployment](danieltov.github.io/whosthatpokemon))

## About

Here is my Pokémon-themed take on Hangman. A user types in a letter using their keyboard and the game compares the keystroke with the answer and either reveals the letter in the hidden word, or alerts the user that their guess was incorrect. But, user beware. They only have 15 tries to guess the name of the Pokémon hidden in the Pokémon.

## Technologies Used
JavaScript, Bootstrap 4

#### Hint: This game only concerns itself with Generation 1 Pokémon. AKA OG Pokémon.
